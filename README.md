# Predictive-Purchase-Order-System

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a predictive system for Domino's to optimize ingredient ordering by forecasting future sales. 
Leveraging historical sales data, we build a model that predicts pizza sales and generates efficient purchase orders,
ensuring optimal stock levels and minimizing waste.

## Key Features
**Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** 
    
    1. Handle missing values, outliers, and format data for analysis.
    
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    
    1. Analyze trends, seasonality, and patterns in historical sales data.
    
**Sales Forecasting:**
    
    1. Implement predictive models (ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, LSTM) to forecast future sales.
    
**Purchase Order Generation:**

    1. Based on sales forecasts, calculate ingredient requirements and create a purchase order.
